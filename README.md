# cryptography-game

During the cryptography game you will be guided through exercises that will lead you to a real-life case of message exchange. The two protagonists of the game are Alice and Bob ( yes always them ). The game consists of three levels. In the first you will have to figure out how to implement a simple encryption algorithm. In the second you will calculate a secret key that the two players will know without having to exchange it. In the last trial of the game you will put all the concepts learned together and have to encrypt and decrypt messages.

## Exercise 1

This exercise provides some tests that currently fail. The idea is that the sender and receiver have a common "bank," they will have to encrypt and decrypt a message through a key and shift the test to the shared bank

## Exercise 2

In this exercise we will use the Diffie-hellman algorithm to generate the public and private keys. In the same way of the first exercise, you have some unit test and you must pass all the test to complete the exercise.

## Exercise 3

In the last exercise you have to interject a conversation between Alice and Bob. The messages that the two exchanged are represented by the file "exercise3.txt". In this case we want to read the messages Alice is sending to Bob. There is a problem, in some cases we were able to read Bob's secret and in others we were not. Try to decode the message ! :)
