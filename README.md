# cryptography-game

During the cryptography game you will be guided through exercises that will lead you to a real-life case of message exchange. The two protagonists of the game are Alice and Bob ( yes always them ). The game consists of three levels. In the first you will have to figure out how to implement a simple encryption algorithm. In the second you will calculate a secret key that the two players will know without having to exchange it. In the last trial of the game you will put all the concepts learned together and have to encrypt and decrypt messages.

## Exercise 1

This exercise provides some tests that currently fail. The idea is that the sender and receiver have a common "bank," they will have to encrypt and decrypt a message through a key and shift the test to the shared bank

## Exercise 2

Instead, in this exercise you will have to use techniques explained in the lecture to calculate public and private keys. Again you have unit tests that you will need to run.

## Exercise 3

This last exercise will be a little different, in fact in this case we have a data matrix, where in each field you will be missing some data that you will have to deduce
